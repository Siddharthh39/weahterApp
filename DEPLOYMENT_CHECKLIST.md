- [ ] Frontend config.js uses `/api` for production

---

## Testing

- [ ] Backend API responds: `curl http://localhost:8000/weather?lat=28&lon=77`
- [ ] Proxy works: `curl http://localhost/api/weather?lat=28&lon=77`
- [ ] Frontend loads in browser
- [ ] Map is visible
- [ ] Clicking on map shows weather popup
- [ ] Weather data displays correctly

## Success Criteria

âœ… **Your deployment is successful when:**

1. You can access the app via `http://YOUR-IP` or `https://your-domain.com`
2. Clicking on the map displays weather information
3. Backend API is running as a systemd service
4. Apache serves the frontend and proxies API requests
5. No errors in logs
6. Application survives server reboot

**Congratulations! Your Weather App is now live on AWS! ðŸŽ‰**

Remember to:
- Monitor logs regularly
- Keep system updated
- Renew SSL certificates (Certbot does this automatically)
- Back up any important data
- Check AWS billing dashboard
