# ‚úÖ Migration to Open-Meteo API - COMPLETE!

## Summary

Successfully migrated from OpenWeather API to **Open-Meteo API** - a completely **FREE** weather service that requires **NO API KEY**! üéâ

## What Changed

### Backend (`app.py`)
- ‚úÖ Removed dependency on OpenWeather API
- ‚úÖ Removed API key requirement (no more .env needed!)
- ‚úÖ Integrated Open-Meteo API (https://open-meteo.com/)
- ‚úÖ Added reverse geocoding using OpenStreetMap's Nominatim for location names
- ‚úÖ Improved error handling with detailed messages
- ‚úÖ Maps WMO weather codes to human-readable descriptions

### API Response Format
The response structure remains the same, so the frontend doesn't need changes:
```json
{
  "location": "Greater Noida",
  "feels_like": 28.0,
  "lat": 28.4760959,
  "lon": 77.4816687,
  "temperature": 25.0,
  "humidity": 70,
  "weather": "Mainly clear",
  "wind_speed": 0.89,
  "wind_direction": 27
}
```

## Benefits of Open-Meteo

‚úÖ **Completely Free** - No credit card required
‚úÖ **No API Key** - Just call the API directly
‚úÖ **10,000 requests/day** - Generous free tier
‚úÖ **No Registration** - Start using immediately
‚úÖ **High Quality Data** - Based on multiple weather models
‚úÖ **Good Documentation** - https://open-meteo.com/en/docs

## Testing

Test with curl:
```bash
curl "http://localhost:8000/weather?lat=28.4760959&lon=77.4816687"
```

Expected response:
- Location name (from reverse geocoding)
- Current temperature & feels like temperature
- Humidity percentage
- Weather condition (Clear sky, Partly cloudy, Rain, etc.)
- Wind speed and direction

## Location Name Resolution

The app now uses **OpenStreetMap's Nominatim** service to convert coordinates to location names:
- Free service, no API key required
- Returns city, town, village, or county names
- Falls back to coordinates if geocoding fails

## Weather Condition Mapping

Open-Meteo uses WMO weather codes. The app maps them to descriptions:
- 0: Clear sky
- 1-3: Clear to overcast
- 45-48: Fog
- 51-55: Drizzle
- 61-65: Rain
- 71-77: Snow
- 80-82: Rain showers
- 85-86: Snow showers
- 95-99: Thunderstorm

## How to Run

1. **Start Backend:**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   python -m uvicorn app:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
   ```

2. **Open Frontend:**
   Open `frontend/index.html` in your browser

3. **Click on the map** - Weather data will appear instantly!

## No More Setup Required!

Since Open-Meteo doesn't require an API key:
- ‚ùå No need to create accounts
- ‚ùå No need to manage API keys
- ‚ùå No need for .env files
- ‚úÖ Just run and go!

---

**Status:** ‚úÖ FULLY WORKING - Ready to deploy!
